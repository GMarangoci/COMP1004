# CVGuide Resume Builder - Single Page Application (SPA)

CareerCanvas is a university project aimed at democratizing the process of resume creation, making it accessible, cost-free, and simple for job seekers and professionals across all industries. Recognizing the barriers presented by expensive and complex resume-building tools, CareerCanvas provides a user-friendly platform where individuals can effortlessly craft professional resumes without financial burden or technical challenges.

## Background

The inception of CareerCanvas was motivated by a personal encounter with the high costs and complexities of existing online resume builders.
